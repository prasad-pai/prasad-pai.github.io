# Reading List

This list keeps track of the books I have read starting the year 2020.
The links where available point to interesting reviews of the book. They are not necessarily why I read them. It is likely that I found them on various book lists or just happened to read a synopsis of the dust jacket. 

## Currently Reading
* The Book of Illusions, Paul Auster
* Shadow & Claw, Gene Wolfe
