# Reading List

This list keeps track of the books I have read starting the year 2020.
The links where available point to interesting reviews of the book. A few of the links point to amazon.com because I most likely picked up these books on a whim.

Books that I liked are marked with an asterisk.

My aim is to read as many books as possible from the [1001 Books: You Must Read Before You Die](https://www.listchallenges.com/1001-books-you-must-read-2018)
